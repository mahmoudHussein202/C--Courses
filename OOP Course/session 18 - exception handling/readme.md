# Exception Handling:
---------------------
* we use exceptional handling in the code section we think errors will occurs in it 
* this allow us to handle with errors immediatly and prevent the stop of the program
# Syntax :
----------
* it is formed up by three sections :
    - [[try]()] we write the code in this section, the code written is we thougt that it will contain an error
    - [[throw]()] when the error occurs, we throw something to be handled, like the error value or a string.
    - [[catch]()] this section will deal with the error with a predefined action.
